Revision history for Perl extension Dist-Joseki

0.19  Mon 2010.02.08 14:03:44 CET (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - v0.18 had loads of requirements but most of them came from a few very
       seldomly used commands, so I moved those out to their own distributions.
     - command plugins now live in Dist::Joseki::Command::*, so it's a nicer
       namespace for putting extra commands in separate CPAN dists
     - removed bin/chkbundle - unclear concept
     - removed bin/version - handled by 'dist version'
     - moved the 'depends' command into its own distribution:
       Dist::Joseki::Command::depends
     - moved the 'depends' command into its own distribution:
       Dist::Joseki::Command::depends

0.18  Mon 2009.12.07 22:59:20 CET (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)

0.15  Mon Oct 20 20:44:17 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - Changed dist style and Changes back to standard. People didn't like it -
