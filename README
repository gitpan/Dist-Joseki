NAME
    Dist::Joseki - Tools for the prolific module author

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    "Joseki" is a japanese term from the game Go and means "a formulaic
    sequence of moves which is established for giving equal outcomes to both
    players", but it has come into general use to describe any fixed form of

    Dist::Joseki offers you tools that help you in developing Perl module
    distributions if you stick to a certain formulaic style of structuring
    your distributions.
